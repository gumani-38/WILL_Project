       and skills, to develop the greatest mindset, to positively influence, change, empower, guide, support, teach, motivate and inspire more <br>
       youth in a form of youth development and mentorship. With more members joining in as mentors and more related organizations getting <br>
       involved as partners, iMentorU Foundation has become a national recognised organization, adopting schools, communities and <br>
       individuals in South Africa. We are a B-BBEE Level 1 Contributor: 135% Procurement recognised organization
